# Global/MDSingleton

The MDSingleton class is a Unity framework utility designed to facilitate the creation and management of Singleton objects within a Unity scene. A Singleton is a design pattern that ensures there is only one instance of a particular class in the application at any given time. This pattern is often used for manager or controller classes to ensure they have a single point of access throughout the application's lifecycle.
